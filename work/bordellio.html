          <p>My biggest achievemet while working at Bordellio was building a pixel perfect landing page in JSX and the CSS library Tachyons.</p>
          <p>I used the skills that I had already developed as well as developed new skills and quickly became familiar with new technologies in order to deliver a high standard of work within the required time frame.</p>
          <p>Some of the technologies I had exposure to included functional CSS, Bitbucket/ Git for version control and NPM/Yarn for vendor dependencies.</p>
          <p>I was expected to work independently as well as in a team which was conducted in an agile environment using Trello.</p>
          <p>I was also involved in competitor analysis, auditing the application then making changes where necessary to ensure that the products functionality, usability and appearance was compatible with all browsers and devices.</p>
          <p>My work was peer reviewed and I also performed pull requests.</p>
